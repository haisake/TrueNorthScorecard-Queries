-- ID05 Number of Long Length of Stay (> 30 days) patients snapshot
-----------------------------------------------
	/*
	Purpose: To compute the LLOS census of currently waiting on the thursday week end of each week. (Snapshot)
	Fundamentally, It seams like we are trying our best to just focus on true inpatients in true inpatient units.
	It's not clear though what the expected definition is.

	The P4P query applies filters in a way that doesn't make this quite clear so I've switched it around here.

	Author: Hans Aisake
	Date Created: June 14, 2018
	Date Updated: April 1, 2018
	Inclusions/Exclusions:
		- true inpatient records only
		- excludes newborns
	Comments:
		I took the base query for indicator 471 for the BSC version FROM Emily, but modified it to be richmond specific.
		Targets are absed on the BSI fiscal period targets. If it is a snapshot it shouldn't be directly comprable to the thursday week end.
		It doens't match the BSc front page because they average accross several periods where as here we just show what it was for the period.

		It looks like the BSC numbers exclude MH from the total

	The claim is that the MoH asked that we exclude NICUs and Carolina sent over some DMR internal documentation stating that they exclude it.
	However, despite my best efforts I haven't been able to very this is a MoH source.
	Peter notes that the MoH excludes newborns, but it was always up to our internal interpretation how we achieve this.

	/*
	Purpose: To pull the sick hours and productive horus from FinanceMart.
	Author: Hans Aisake
	Date Created: October 3, 2018
	Date Modified: May 10, 2019
	Inclusions/Exclusions:
	Comments:
		Carolina was consulted for the specs. I took some liberties to blend the query she sent and what was in the financeportal reports.
		It removes casual productive and sick hours.

		The arugment was made that casuals don't get sick hours normally, and instead they just don't get paid.
		There are also some technical issues with how we determine overtime pay and sick time pay for casuals because it's based on strange employment criteria.
		Casuals choose which days are their "days off" and get OT for comming in on those days. -Not 100% certain this is true, but I have reason to lean this way.
		Because of this we exclude casuals hours from the indicator. 
		For some areas this can be 15% of the total productive hours.
		I don't have casual budgeted productive hours and can't remove them.

-- ID15 Acute Productive Hours Per Patient Day
-----------------------------------------------
/*
Purpose: To compute productive hours and inpatient days from financemart for a series of financial breakdown categories.
There may be an issue with one specific program and or unallocated funds not being mapped out to correct programs, but that can only be done with further data and manual investigation.
It is not worth sorting that out here.

Comments:

I got this query from Stella and she notes that it is updated from time to time.
I need more details to make this robust enough so all those changes are easily made.

For whatever reason we use CIHIMISgroupings  71210, 71220, 71230, 71240, 71250, 71270, 71275, 71280, 7131040 and 71290 as cost center filters.
Those groupings a high level, so the CTE finds all specific cost centers under the groupings for inclusion.
I replaced the whole #temp1 through #temp11 and #temp 3 logic with just one #tempX table because there was no reason for the 180ish lines of eduplicate code.
refer to version 4 June if you want that back, but I can't see why you would.
